# Test Automation Portfolio

Welcome to my Test Automation Portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of test scripts and projects I have developed to demonstrate my skills in test automation. The tests cover various technologies and scenarios, including Python, Selenium, pytest, etc.

## Overview

This repository serves as a central hub to present my test automation projects. The actual test scripts are located in this repository or separate repositories, linked below. Each project includes tests that cover specific functionalities or use cases.
