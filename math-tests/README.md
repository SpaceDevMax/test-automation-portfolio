# Math Tests

This subfolder contains automated test scripts for mathematical operations and functions. The tests are designed to validate the correctness of mathematical computations in a few scenarios.

## Overview

The `math-tests` directory includes test cases for basic arithmetic and geometric calculations.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required library: `pytest` (install via `pip install pytest`)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

2. Navigate to the math-tests folder:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/math-tests

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

  ## Running Tests

  To execute all tests, run:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```
  To run a specific test file:
  ```bash
  pytest test_arithmetic.py
  ```

## Tests

  - test_arithmetic.py: Tests for basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
  - test_geometry.py: Tests for geometry.py.
  - geometry.py: Geometric calculations (rectangle area, circle area).
